### TODO

1. Sometimes dependency specified in the POM may not indicate the version directly. In order to determine the correct version we should check the parent POM.

2. Integrated service with Prometheus metrics. 
* log errors
* log number of created nodes, relations

3. Store exclusions for dependency

4. Resolve properties into version numbers (property may be defined in current POM or in parent POM!)
