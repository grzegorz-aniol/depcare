### TODO

1. Sometimes dependency specified in the POM may not indicate the version directly. In order to determine the correct version we should check the parent POM.
2. Store exclusions for dependency
3. Resolve properties into version numbers (property may be defined in current POM or in parent POM!)
4. Some modules were published into more than one repository. Therefore attributes like urls or publishedAt should be arrays.
